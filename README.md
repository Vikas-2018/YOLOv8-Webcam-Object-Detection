# YOLOv8-Webcam-Object-Detection
This project implements a real-time object detection system using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 deep learning model with OpenCV. The system captures live video feed from a laptop webcam, processes each frame through the YOLOv8 model to detect objects, and displays bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores on the video stream.

# YOLOv8-Webcam-Object-Detection
This project implements a real-time object detection system using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 deep learning model with OpenCV. The system captures live video feed from a laptop webcam, processes each frame through the YOLOv8 model to detect objects, and displays bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores on the video stream.


# Key Features
Real-time object detection on live webcam feed.

Utilizes the latest YOLOv8 architecture from Ultralytics for high accuracy and fast inference.

Visualizes detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

Easy to run and extend for custom datasets or applications.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.11

OpenCV for video capture and image processing

Ultralytics YOLOv8 for object detection

# Use Cases
Surveillance and monitoring systems.

Real-time object tracking.

Educational demonstration of deep learning in computer vision.

Foundation for further enhancements like custom training, tracking, and alerting.
